Yes, all these projects require the use of smart contracts and Solidity. Hereâ€™s the list sorted from easiest to hardest, along with their value as projects for your CV:

### 1. **Token Creation** (Easiest)
   - **Why**: This is a fundamental project that introduces you to the ERC20 standard and basic smart contract development. It's a great starting point and essential knowledge for any Solidity developer.
   - **CV Value**: High. Tokens are widely used, and showcasing your ability to create one demonstrates your understanding of blockchain fundamentals.

### 2. **Decentralized Lottery**
   - **Why**: A step up from token creation, this project introduces randomness and fairness, which are crucial in blockchain applications.
   - **CV Value**: Medium. A lottery is a simple but effective way to show your ability to handle complex logic and randomness in smart contracts.

### 3. **Crowdfunding Platform**
   - **Why**: This project involves more interaction between users and introduces concepts like fund management and conditional transfers.
   - **CV Value**: High. Crowdfunding is a popular use case for blockchain, and this project demonstrates practical skills in managing funds and user interactions.

### 4. **Multi-signature Wallet**
   - **Why**: This project is slightly more complex, requiring an understanding of security mechanisms and multi-party agreements.
   - **CV Value**: High. Multi-signature wallets are a critical security feature, and developing one showcases your ability to create secure, multi-user applications.

### 5. **Escrow Service**
   - **Why**: Similar to a multi-signature wallet but with the added complexity of conditional fund release based on external agreements.
   - **CV Value**: High. Escrow services are essential in many blockchain applications, and building one demonstrates your ability to handle conditional logic and user trust issues.

### 6. **Decentralized Voting System**
   - **Why**: This project introduces transparency, immutability, and user privacy, all important aspects of blockchain applications.
   - **CV Value**: High. Voting systems are crucial for governance in decentralized environments, and building one shows your understanding of these key concepts.

### 7. **NFT Marketplace**
   - **Why**: This project requires you to understand ERC721 (or similar) standards and handle more complex interactions like auctions and royalties.
   - **CV Value**: Very High. NFTs are a booming area, and showcasing your ability to build a marketplace demonstrates advanced skills in smart contract development.

### 8. **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**
   - **Why**: DAOs involve complex governance mechanisms and require a deep understanding of smart contracts and community decision-making processes.
   - **CV Value**: Very High. DAOs are at the cutting edge of decentralized governance, and building one highlights your ability to create sophisticated, community-driven applications.

### 9. **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**
   - **Why**: DEXs are highly complex, involving liquidity pools, order matching, and security concerns.
   - **CV Value**: Very High. DEXs are critical in the DeFi space, and building one showcases your ability to handle complex financial transactions and smart contract security.

### 10. **Stablecoin** (Hardest)
    - **Why**: Building a stablecoin involves understanding and implementing mechanisms to maintain price stability, which can be highly complex.
    - **CV Value**: Extremely High. Stablecoins are central to the blockchain ecosystem, and developing one demonstrates top-tier skills in both finance and smart contract development. 

Starting with simpler projects like token creation and gradually moving towards more complex ones like a decentralized exchange will provide you with a solid foundation and impressive projects to showcase on your CV.
